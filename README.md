# Google Books Search Engine

## Application Functionality 

This application uses google book's API to retrieve books and allow users to save those books to their accounts. This application runs on expressjs and react using GraphQL to communicate with its MongoDB Database responsible for storing all user data.

## My Role

For this application I was given a working version that was based on a traditional REST architecture. I worked to refactor the server and clientside codebases to work through GraphQl.

## Deployed Application
